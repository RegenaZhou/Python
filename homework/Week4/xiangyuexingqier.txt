Mitch:"If you had a full healthy day, what would you do?"
Morrie:"Twenty-four hours?"
Morrie:"Let's see...I'd get up in the morning,do my exercises,have a lovely breakfast of sweet rolls and tea,
go for a swim,then have my friends come over for a nice lunch.I'd have them come one or two at a time
so we could talk about their families,their issues,talk about how much mean to each other."
Morrie:"Then I'd like to go for a walk,in a garden with some trees,watch their colors,watch the birds,
take in the nature that I haven't seen in so long now."
Morrie:"In the evening,we'd all go together to a restaurant with some great pasta,maybe some duck-I love duckand
then we'd dance the rest of the night.I'd dance with all the wonderful dance partners out there,until I was exhausted.
And then I'd go home and have a deep,wonderful sleep."
